Is there any other way I could select features? Could I e.g. run a random forest and use a feature importance report from that to also select the most important features? Then run a regression?

Use MSE, R^2 mainly

Consider playing around with LASSO or Ridge-regressions, as these punish features with low predictive power. These are simple and strong methods for linear purposes.
